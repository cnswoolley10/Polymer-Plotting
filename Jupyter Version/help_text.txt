Hello! Welcome to this polymer plotting program.
This program plots the shape of polymer chains as formed by some simple models (plus maybe in future some demo shapes).

DISCLAIMER: This program was written by a part II materials student with < 1 year coding experience.
Some bits may not be best optimised, pls no hate, feedback always welcome :)

Please read this help text before sending any issues.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USING THIS GUI:      (You don't have to use the GUI, see the GitHub readme above)

1. Set the values for the chains in the left hand pain. Keep total sum of chain length<20000 for fast calculation.
2. Check your chain values and then click confirm all. This will calculate your chain geometries and store them in memory.
3. Click plot to see your chains!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FULL INFO:
There are four panes:
MAIN:
	- Plot - Plots the chains stored in the memory
	- Exit - Exits the GUI and ends the program
	- Help - Looks like you've figured this one out

CHAIN OPTIONS:
	- Confirm all - Takes the chains as specified below this button, calculates their shapes and saves them to memory. This is done rather than to auto-calculate because the program begins to slow for chains longer than ~10000 segments
	- Clear all	  - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED Sets all the chains to 'None' and saves to memory
	
	CHAIN X:
		- Chain type   - Set the model with which the chain is created
		- Chain length - Set the number of segments in the chain
		NOTE: You'll see most parameters of the models are currently only presets and not user-editable (this will change in future)
			The current presets are: (Chosen to reflect carbon chain properties)
				ALL: segment length = 1
				FR & RI: bond angle = 109.5
				RI: number of torsion positions = 3 (t, g+, g-)
					trans configuration bias = 2 (how many times more likely the trans configuration is compared to any one of the others)
		- Right click  - Right click the chain name to confirm chains individually or print the stored coordinates
	
	PROPERTIES CALCULATOR:
		Properties are:
			- N	    - Number of segments in the chains
			- l     - Length of each segments
			- E2E   - End to end distance
			- CoM   - Centre of Mass
			- RoG   - Radius of gyration
		- Calculate - Calculates the selected properties of the chains stored in the memory and prints to info pane
		- Save      - Save to .csv the selected properties of the chains stored in the memory

PLOTTING:
	This is all the standard GUI imported from matplotlib.
	NOTE: the zoom button doesn't work due to being in 3D.
		Can still zoom by click&drag with right mouse button
		LMB to pan as you'd expect.
		MMB to traverse.

INFO:
	Any calculations will be printed here as well as info messages.
	Get a larger version of the textbox with the popout button. You can edit and save the output text from the popout.
