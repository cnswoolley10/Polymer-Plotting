# Polymer-Plotting
Plotting various models for polymers in python.

DISCLAIMER: This program was written by a student with < 1 year coding experience.
Some bits may not be best optimised, pls no hate, feedback always welcome :)

This is also the first time I've used GitHub and have absolutely no clue what I'm doing.

In this GitHub Repo exists some code for plotting polymer chains. 
The core is built around 'polymer_chains.py', which defines classes for various models of chain, if you've coded before then understanding this will be pretty easy.
You can use the objects defined in 'polymer_chains.py' to write your own code for maximum flexibility.
If you don't like coding then you can run 'PolymerPlottingGUI.py' to get a user interface version, with lots of pre-defined functionality, but less flexibility.

Python dependencies are: Numpy, Matplotlib and PySimpleGUI (GUI only).

There is also a folder containing all the necessary bits to run the most recently exported version as an .exe file.
Save the whole folder, then run the executable within it. This should need no python installation at all, though I don't have a digital signature to sign .exe files, so windows will tell you it doesn't know who the publisher is :(.
